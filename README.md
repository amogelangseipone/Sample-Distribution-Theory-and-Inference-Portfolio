# Sample-Distribution-Theory-and-Inference-Portfolio
This repository contains the work from my Sample Distribution Theory and Inference portfolio, completed as part of my academic studies. The project explores statistical methods related to sample distributions, hypothesis testing, and inference, focusing on how sample data can inform larger population conclusions.

## Project Highlights:
### Monte Carlo Simulation: Used R to implement and analyze Monte Carlo simulations, which allowed me to explore complex statistical phenomena through random sampling.
### Statistical Inference: Applied various statistical tests and methods to evaluate sample data and draw inferences about populations.
### Self-Learning: Utilized YouTube tutorials, academic papers, and AI tools like ChatGPT to enhance understanding of advanced statistical methods.
### Distinction Achievement: Achieved a distinction for the project, demonstrating a strong grasp of statistical concepts and real-world application.
